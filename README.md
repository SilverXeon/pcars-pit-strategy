# pcars-pit-strategy

This project is a strategy planner for project cars 2.

For this, i'm planning to use the functionality of Pcars Profiler to export to CSV to fill a database with the laptime, fuel used and tyre usure
Then with some maths (bruteforce) the planner will give you the best pit strategy to have the best race time in a given number of laps.
